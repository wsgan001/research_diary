#### [Forward Secure Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption with Efficient Updates](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1449-kimA.pdf)

> forward security enables to thwart those attacks by hiding the information about the newly added files matching a previous search query.

file-injection attacks: 

>  once files sophisticatedly composed of keywords chosen from the keyword universe are injected to the encrypted database, the keywords corresponding to any future search tokens sent by the client could be revealed

dual dictionary

> $label_i^{(1)}=H(key^{ind},i)$, for i = 1,...t
>
> $label_i^{(2)}=H(key^{(w_i)},cnt^{(w_i)}+1)$, for i = 1,..t, $cnt^{(w_i)}$ denotes the number of documents containing $w_i$ in the EDB before adding the document
>
> $Dic_1=\{(label_i^{(1)},label_i^{(2)})\},Dic_2=\{(label_i^{(2)},(label_i^{(1)},ind))\}$



security model: DSSE scheme does not leak more than the identifier and the number of keywords of the newly added document

> A DSSE scheme is **forward secure** if there exists a leakage function $\bar{\mathcal{L}}$ s.t. its $\mathcal{L}_{Addition}$ can be written as $\mathcal{L}_{Addition}(ind,W)=\bar{\mathcal{L}}(ind,|W|)$
