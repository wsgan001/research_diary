#### [ACES: Automatic Compartments for Embedded Systems](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/publications/papers/2018/aces_usenixsec18_revision.pdf)

#### Contributions

- ACES moves away from the constraint in MINION and $\mu$Visor that an entire process or threads needs to be at the same privilege level
- Separating the compartmentalization policy from the program implementation, which enables exploration of security-performance trade-offs for different compartmentalization policies

#### Threat Model 

- attacker tries to gain arbitrary code execution
- software itself is trustworthy(buggy but not malicious)
- hardware has a Memory Protection Unit(MPU), which is similar to an MMU but does not provide **virtual memory address translation**

- MPU
  - On ARMv7-M architecture MPU can define up to 8 regions, start at at a multiple of its size, which is a power of two

#### Design

- ACES‘ design allows PDG creation using static analysis, dynamic analysis or a hybrid
- Initial region graph is created by mapping all functions and data nodes in the PDG along with their associated edges
- **merging regions**
- ACES generate the appropriate MPU configuration from the final region graph

- implementation: program analysis, compartment generation, program instrumentation, enforcement of protections at runtime
