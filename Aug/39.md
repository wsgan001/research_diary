#### What is a blockchain?

- just like a link list, based on asymmetric cryptographical encryption

- a transaction is a node in the link list, which contains 3 components:
  - Owner's public key
  - Hash value
  - Previous owner's signature
- focus on the owner 2's transaction in the above figure, first it hash the last transaction(here the owner 1's transaction) with its public key, then pack its public key, hash value and the previous's signature together, hence it makes a new coin, everyone can use the owner 1's public key to verify the owner 1's signature in this coin,
