#### [Collusion-Tolerable Privacy-Preserving Sum and Product Calculation without Secure Channel](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/paper/Journal/SecureAggregation-TDSC.pdf)

- previous work: 
  - require secure pair-wise channels: both HE & SMC, request keys via secure channel.
  - high complexity: SMC & fully HE

- [this paper](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xiangyangli/paper/Journal/SecureAggregation-TDSC.pdf)
  - reduce the complexity to linear time
  - insecure channels
  - tolerate $k$ passive adversaries

#### Related Work

- Castelluccia et al., HE scheme: 
  - provable secure & efficient
  - modular addition, good for nodes in WSN
- Sheikt et al., k-secure sum protocol
  - segments data
  - significantly reduced the prob. of data leakage
- He et al.,  SMART, similar to above
  - segments data into $n$ slices, distributes $n-1$ slices via secure channel
  - only sum
  - $O(n)$ complexity communication overhead
- Shi et al., similar to our solution
  - periodically upload encrypted data
  - brute-force search  or Pollard's $\lambda$ method, so **restricted**
- Our scheme
  - no trusted aggregator
  - insecure channels
  - segments $k$ data, constant communication overhead
  - based on DDH assumption
  - novel efficient protocols

#### Complexity

each participant sends $m$ ciphertexts to the aggregator:

- One Aggregator Model

| Aggregator       | Computation | Communication |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Product          | O(mn)       | O(mn\|p\|)    |
| Sum              | O(m)        | O(m\|p\|)     |
| Per Participant  | Computation | Communication |
| Setup(Product)   | O(1)        | O(\|p\|)      |
| Encrypt(Product) | O(m)        | O(m\|p\|)     |
| Setup(Sum)       | O(1)        | O(\|p\|)      |
| Encrypt(Sum)     | O(1)        | O(\|p\|)      |

- Participants Only Model

| Per Participant | Computation | Communication |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Setup(Prod)     | O(1)        | O(\|p\|)      |
| Encrypt(Prod)   | O(m)        | O(mn\|p\|)    |
| Product(Prod)   | O(mn)       | O(mn\|p\|)    |
| Setup(Sum)      | O(1)        | O(\|p\|)      |
| Encrypt(Sum)    | O(1)        | O(m\|p\|)     |
| Sum(Sum)        | O(m)        | O(m\|p\|)     |
