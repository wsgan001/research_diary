#### [Comparing the Usability of Cryptographic APIs](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/shb17/fahl.pdf)

In this paper, the authors make a survey about the usability of cryptographic APIs in the most popular Python libs, and tell us how choice of library affects developers. A simplicity library can promote the security, but it cannot entirely solve the problem, therefore missing features and documents often cause many insecure result. The authors advise new cryptographic libraries should be designed to offer :

- a simple convenient interface
- broad range of common task 
- accessible doc, in particular easy-to-use code examples

Python Libraries:

- PyCrypto: most popular
- M2Crypto: binding to OpenSSL, widely used
- cryptography.io: more usable security
- Keyczar: easier to use
- PyNaCl: focus on usability



In fact, I think the most valuable part to me in this paper is about how to design and complete an Internet survey, which differs from the theoretical research. There are many details need to be handled, these directly affects the quality of the survey, and is also a difficult work.
